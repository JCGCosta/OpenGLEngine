# OpenGLEngine
Is a project made to the computer graphics discipline were using glew and glfw3, i build some simple engine for 2d game creation.

With that project i was able to learn more on how to handle rotation, scalling, projection, translation, shaders and rendering from graphic objects, also how to handle in a high level: moviment and collisions.
